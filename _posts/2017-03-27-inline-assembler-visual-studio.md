## Inline assembler Visual Studio - 1

Few days ago I write code for first laboratory work in computer architecture and today I push it on github.

In this post I try to tell some notions of assembler and computer architecture.

### Registers
I will consider a 32-bit x86 architecture.

There are three groups of registers:
- General registers
- Control registers
- Segment registers
